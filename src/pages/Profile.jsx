            Twenty three years old computer science student. I love lifting
            weights, actually I'm a competitive powerlifter, but also I have had
            a strong passion for web technologies since I was a kid. On a first
            look two very different things, but in reality they are very
            similar. You canâ€™t slack on, because technologies are moving at such
            a pace and I love it. I have a competitive and versatile
            personality. Consistency and dedication are the keys of success in
            my beliefs.
